A bit about me!
I love to code, clearly :) but my other hobbies include creating art(drawing mostly), knitting, writing life reflecting stories and dancing. I'm excited to start my journey of becoming a software engineering as I continue to build my protfolio on Github, expand my skillset and take up more opportunities that allow me to grow as an engineer!
Feel free to contact me! I'm always happy to connect!
