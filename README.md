A bit about me!
I love to code, clearly :) but my other hobbies include creating art(drawing mostly), knitting, writing life relfecting stories and dancing. I'm exicted to start my jounrney of becoming a software engineering as I continue to build my protfolio on Github, expand my skillset and take up more opportunities that allow me to grow as an engineer!
Feel free to contact me! I always happy to connect!
